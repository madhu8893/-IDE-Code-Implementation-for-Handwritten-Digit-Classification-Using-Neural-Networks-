## Logic or Method Used
The logic used in this project is based on **image classification using deep learning**.  
The handwritten digit image is given as input to the neural network. Each image is represented by pixel values, and the model learns patterns such as curves, edges, and shapes of digits from **0 to 9**. During training, the neural network adjusts its internal weights to improve accuracy. After training, the system can classify new handwritten digit images correctly.

## Model or Technique Applied
The technique used in this project is **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**.

The neural network consists of:
- **Input Layer** – receives image pixel values
- **Hidden Layers** – learns patterns and features
- **Output Layer** – predicts the digit class from **0 to 9**

A **feedforward neural network** with **ReLU** and **Softmax** activation functions is used for classification.
